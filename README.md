Super Mario inspired game in python created for our brother's (Coco) wedding as a best man speech. 
Starts off as regular Mario and then takes an unexpected turn. 

Custom graphics by Vince.

Requires python (written with 2.7) and pygame (www.pygame.org). 
Note: classes, methods and variable names are mostly in French.
Music taken from youtube, I would like to list due credits.

If we have a game pad, you can plug it in, it should just work.
Otherwise use the arrow keys for direction, x and c to run / jump.

Launch supercoco.py to run the game.

Enjoy !
